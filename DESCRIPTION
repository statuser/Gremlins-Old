Description: The model in "Gremlins in the Data" seeks to identify
    research subjects that provide low information in a heterogeneous
    multinomial logit model.  This is especially useful for conjoint
    analysis studies where survey respondents may answer randomly rather
    than pay careful attention to the task.
